    "bio": "My passion for teaching was sparked when I became a teaching assistant in graduate school. Through this experience, I was able to develop a deep skill set with effective and clear communication that I used to give students meaningful feedback on film projects, resulting in dramatic improvements in the quality of students’ work which lead some to have their work accepted into film festivals. That role inspired me to learn more about the teaching profession and I really became passionate about young adult education. While I was a special education teacher in Los Angeles Unified School District I was able to use my Open Mindedness, Flexibility and Interpersonal skills to develop a highly successful classroom where every student could thrive at their independent level. I was able to solve problems brought to me by parents and administrators, and deliver effective solutions, while saving the school valuable resources. I was called on by my Principle because of my proven ability to make decisions in previous projects, to lead as our school testing coordinator implementing national, state, and District mandated testing programs and analyzing and interpreting test results for the entire school, administrators, and parents. I find great satisfaction being able to collaborate, and helping people to meet deadlines while working under pressure. I’m looking to launch a career in Education Technology. I'd like to work in a Software Engineering role with an innovative team working to enrich and stimulate young minds while creating game-changing opportunities in the world of education."
